Series:  A series is a one-dimensional NumPy-like array. 
You can put any data type in here, and perform vectorized operations on it. 
A series is also dictionary - like in many ways. Usually this is denoted as "s."
- dictionary-like 

DataFrame: Two-dimensional NumPy-like array. 
Again, any data type can be stuffed in here. 
Usually this is denoted as "df"
- dictionary-like => df['Column1']

index = This is what the data is "associated" by. 
So if you have time series data, like stock price information, generally the "index" is the date

Slicing - Selecting specific batches of data. 
(Move Columns or reorganise, do mathmatical operations on rows)
